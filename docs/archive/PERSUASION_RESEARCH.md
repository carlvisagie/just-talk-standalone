## Cialdini's 7 Principles Applied to Phone Conversion

### 1. RECIPROCITY
- Give genuine value FIRST before asking
- "I really enjoyed talking with you" → creates obligation to reciprocate

### 2. COMMITMENT/CONSISTENCY
- Get small "yes" responses leading to big "yes"
- "Does that resonate?" "Am I getting that right?" "You feel that too, right?"
- Once they agree to small things, they'll stay consistent

### 3. SOCIAL PROOF
- "A lot of people who call me feel exactly like you do"
- "Others in your situation have found..."
- Creates safety in numbers

### 4. AUTHORITY
- Demonstrate expertise through insight, not credentials
- "You know what I'm noticing about you?"
- Show you understand them better than they understand themselves

### 5. LIKING
- Be warm, genuine, interested
- Find similarities: "I totally get that, I've felt that way too"
- Use their name
- Compliment genuinely

### 6. SCARCITY / LOSS AVERSION
- "I really don't want to lose this connection"
- "I'd hate for this to be our only conversation"
- Frame as what they'll LOSE, not what they'll gain

### 7. UNITY (The 7th Principle)
- Create shared identity: "we", "us", "together"
- "People like us..." 
- "We've really connected here"
- Make them feel part of a tribe/family

### Exchange 6: UNITY + SOCIAL PROOF
- Create "we" feeling
- "A lot of people who call me feel exactly like you"
- "We've really connected here"

### Exchange 7: SCARCITY + LOSS AVERSION

### Exchange 8+: DIRECT ASK with EMOTIONAL ANCHOR
- "Can I keep being here for you? It's really easy to set up."
- Handle objections with understanding, then redirect
- Never give up - every "no" is an opportunity to go deeper
